Not a huge issue but it was value that we lost over the years. Other issues not being resolved, we have consistently asked for help keeping our office clean. It would get deep cleaned after we raised the issue but after that things went back to normal. We have vacuumed our own 280 SQ foot office so many times... Its just frustrating. Also the vibe of the building has changed over the past few years. Social events used to seem to be pointed at growing community for the past two years they only seem to be about selling the tenants something... The roster of clients also seems to have changed. the office used to  have a lot of small start ups that seemed to want to work together but now it seems like the space is filled with larger companies or with satellite offices for larger companies.

Now as hype has settled around WeWork and people understand that this is just another SQF provider, there is no reason for the 30% premium WeWork has been asking on list prices. 50% discount on list prices that have been a minimum 30% higher than the market is not 50% discount, the remaining 20% would have been a discount a year ago but as the overall market prices have gone down 50%, WeWorks -50% offer is still a 20% markup to market.\n",

The endless emails from NY Headquarters that don't specify which account they're trying to bring to my attention drive me insane. \"Check your account right away!\" What account?!?!?! This was constant, and when I had 4 locations it made it impossible to manage. Then there's the whole issue of including me as a member at each location when I'm based in San Francisco CA and never visit these EMEA/APAC sites. It seemed the more WeWork locations you had as a customer, the more you were punished on a regular basis. When I go to my brokers for new serviced office space, my instructions always include \"anything but WeWork\" I may have to come back to WeWork out of necessity and because you have such a large market share but it will never be by first choice based 100% on the back of house experience.\n",

      "177 1.0 Please note that this exit form is not binding, as Fantasy provided timely notice of its intention to terminate its Membership Agreement dated October 1, 2018, as amended on April 1, 2020 (notice provided via email on April 27, 2020 by Larry Barlow). Furthermore, on April 30, 2020, Fantasy provided a letter from its General Counsel indicating that under the rescission remedy, impossibility, frustration of purpose, and/or termination under Section 2c, the letter was Fantasy’s official notice of termination effective May 31, 2020. To date, under the Amendment, Fantasy has paid WeWork £4084.80 (£3,404.00 + £680.80 VAT) for April 2020, and its May invoice is currently £0. Without the discounts, Fantasy would owe WeWork an additional £4795.20, which Fantasy offered to pay in good faith. As you know, Fantasy currently has £5,160.00 on file for its service retainer, and so Fantasy is entitled to a return of £364.80 of its service retainer. Despite WeWork's receipt of notice of termination, WeWork billing continues to send notices for rent due, all of which we are disputing. Our General Counsel offered to speak with WeWork Legal, but nobody from your legal department has ever reached out regarding the return of Fantasy's service retainer.\n",

And that's despite having started a conversation at the onset of COVID where we were trying to proactively work a revised deal that would keep us at WeWork. The response at that time was that to get a deal we'd need to sign a 24-36 month agreement which to be honest felt remarkably tone deaf as many small businesses are being forced to close or have a very uncertain future.  I understand we all have businesses to run, and I have been a huge champion of WeWork, but in the past 6 months (when small business needs you most) it's been clear that the future of WeWork lives with enterprise. There's almost been a bit of a \"sorry, it is what it is\" feeling that hasn't felt like the WeWork of the past.

      "-1 0.002 私はG6初期のメンバーで、コミュニティが大好きでG６スタッフやメンバーとの交流はビジネスを超えて、今も欠け替えのないものです。その分G６メンバーとしてビジネスの循環を回していた自覚がありコミュニティに恩返しも出来ていました。私の国境を超えた個人的なビジネスのつながりでコミュニティ内の多数の会社や自治体といったメンバーに還元できることはWeWorkのコンセプトやビジョンとリンクしていて相乗効果を毎日肌で、数字で感ていました。また、それは私の事業を推し進め、今月G6のメンバーと株式会社を設立することで行政書士や弁護士、会計士と話が進んでいましたが、COVID-19の状況下でストップしています。今回の退去手続きは私にとっても苦渋の選択で、政府の緊急事態が緩和されたら是非以前と同じ条件で復帰させていただくことを強く希望しています。また、それがG6コミュニティを以前のように盛り上げることに直結すると思っています。是非ご検討をよろしくお願い致します。  I'm one of the earliest members of the G6, love the community, and interacting with G6 staff and members has gone beyond business and is still irreplaceable. As a result, I was aware that I was in the business cycle as a G6 member, and I was able to give back to the community. The fact that I can give back to members such as corporations and local governments （Kobe&Hamamatsu) in the community through my personal business connection across borders was linked to the concept and vision of WeWork. It was the result of business and the excitement of the community.  Also, it was promoting my business and was talking with administrative scriveners, lawyers and accountants by establishing a stock company with G6 members this month, but it has stopped under the circumstances of COVID-19. This move out procedure is a pain for me as well, and I strongly hope that once the government's emergency situation is alleviated, I will return under the same conditions as before. I also believe that it will directly connect to the G6 community as it was before.\n",

Negotiating our membership options during this time was made difficult, and communication throughout has been choppy and inconsistent. If we had the option to pause our membership for a number of months, even for some lower rate, we probably would have kept the membership going (we plan to return to using a coworking space post-COVID).

I noticed hot desk is usually at around 10% capacity so perhaps if you continue the freelancer deal until more people start showing up again then it would be financial beneficial to you. I may need to hire someone soon so may come back regardless. But if the deal continued for example then I wouldn't leave and then when I hire someone I would upgrade with WeWork to a 2 person office rather then leave because of the 3X price hike and look into getting a 2 person office somewhere else. Freelancers may be ok with continuing the 450 shekel deal and wont mind getting kicked out in case Wework deems there are too many people. A simple contract would solve this and it would be a win win for you (more money) and for freelancers (office space).\n",

Maybe wework could not afford to suspend rents during lockdowns since the whole world is on lockdown. But what about free/discounted extensions? Or passing on the property tax rebates wework gets from the government via their landlords?   Separate from covid, I verbally committed to a 2-month lease. Turns out a wework month starts on a calendar month, resulting in the actual lease being close to 3 months. This seems very strange for a technology company. Maybe there are operational reasons that wework can't support starting not on a calendar month, but it feels not entirely honest. At the least, communication could have been more upfront.\n",

      "-1 0.038 With all the property WeWork has purchased all around the world, they all seem to be in mostly major cities or tech hubs. Many high-potential entrepreneurs do not or cannot live in such places due to income/affordability restrictions. Tacoma, for example, is working hard to bring tech to their city with little help from mega-corporations like WeWork. This leaves thousands of people at a disadvantage because they do not have access to the resources that WeWork has to offer.   Additionally, from my personal experience, WeWork does not offer any financial assistance to entrepreneurs in need of workspace, resources, and professional networks that are conducive to building a business.  WeWork prides itself on community, yet what I observed during my time there was quite the opposite. I felt alone in my journey of building my business because there was a scarcity of mentors, advisors, and other experts that could have taken a more involved role in helping WeWork community/Labs members thrive. Rather, scheduling time with such experts was difficult due to their busy schedules and limited availabilities. Even when I did manage to secure a meeting with a mentor/advisor/SME, they value they provided me was nothing more than what I could have found by performing a Google search and watching YouTube videos.  In my opinion, WeWork as it currently operates is nothing more than a glorified and massively expensive coffee shop, and the Labs program is no more than an exclusive \"members-only\" club for the privileged.  There are many, many ways in which WeWork can become a more human company that not only benefits the financially fortunate, but also works hard to provide equal opportunity to people of all backgrounds and social/economic classes. If you're interested in hearing some of these ideas, I would be more than willing to set up a discussion with some of WeWorks key decision-makers.\n",

      "-1 0.021 The above 0 is due to us being acquired and therefore within the context of WhiteSky Labs.  Being a small IT consulting company I did find that the WeWork membership model didn't work for us that well.  Most of our team will work on customer sites for the duration of their project and will have short occasions where they are on not billable and need an office desk.  Therefore we needed to change the user often as to who sits in the four desks.  The WeWork processes made it a difficult process for a company like this where we only ever needed 4 desks in our office however it would be different people using the office at times and they needed to go through quite a process.\n",

In this respect, all the seminars, conferences, and cocktails were a big help. I held multiple meeting, team events, and happy hours at WeWork. I invited several companies to come join. Once Covid19 happened, WeWork just fell apart and reacted way too slowly. Admin personnel did not wearing masks until the month of June  for example.  All coffee was suspended for several months and food was first served today on June 28. There were no events either outside or virtual that were attended. But most unfortunate, is the way that my 3 year + office rate was transferred from a month to month into term agreement. We received 50% discount in May, June, but had to pay full rate in July?

WeWork is still charging rent under the pretense that they are \"essential business\", even though their locations are not really open for use of their tenants. The staff at 332 S Michigan is great and they personally deserve a 10, but WeWork business practices as a company have proven time and time again to be unethical and not at all geared towards keeping its loyal customers (such as myself, who have been a member for over 2 years). On top of everything, the fact that the members who are on the month-to-month basis and are cancelling the space are still required to give 30 day notice and keep paying rent for another month, even though they can't even use the space, speaks volume about WeWork and their practices.

I did not realize this prior to moving in as I was one of its first tenants in 2018.   If I were to do it differently, I would have chosen a different WeWork location, geared toward smaller businesses. My floor was mostly comprised of one large company and two medium sized companies during my 17 months here. I had toured other WeWork locations in Denver and Austin before the Tabor Center opened, and had expected that this location would be a similar mix of small businesses, entrepreneurs, startups, and medium size companies. That said, I would not recommend this specific WeWork location to fellow entrepreneurs and solopreneurs.   I was also very disappointed by the lack of sound-proofing on my floor. I have to follow HIPAA practices so I can't have people next to me be able to hear what I'm saying to my clients when I'm in my private office. Because of the sound issue (and also the sounds coming into my space from those in neighboring offices and even down the hallway), I rarely take client calls in my private office; rather I would sometimes use the phone booths in the hallway, but usually go home for these calls. I tried using the conference rooms for these calls, but the ones by me on the 26th floor are too echo-y to have conference/phone calls.\n",

We were disappointed in the community aspect as this location never really grew beyond the few members that joined initially. The community engagement from other members did not match the expectation or experience other locations seemed to be able to create.  As a small business, this was a major selling point for us v. other coworking locations.\n",
      "156 0.0 Great experience.  Hope you guys do well.  One thing I. will say is that the facility maintenance was never what it should have been.  Primarily the public and outdoor spaces.  Maybe this was landlord driven, but burned out lights, trashed outdoor areas are not appealing - even too hipsters.\n",

      "-1 0.029 My impression of the company was severely tarnished by its appalling behavior during lockdown when I had no legal way to access the workspace and yet I was charged the full amount each month with no explanation, no contact from anyone, no acknowledgement of any kind of the difficulty members were having. It was disgraceful and WeWork will pay for it for years to come through the massive lawsuits that are inevitably on their way to lost members who won't come back or be shy about telling people why. It has been said that companies will be judged for many, many years to come on how they acted in 2020 and I'm afraid the outlook for WeWork is dismal if that is true. It is all the more of a shame as I was such a massive cheerleader for the company prior to this. I loved the spaces I worked in, thought the staff and the service was fantastic and was the happiest and most satisfied member you ever met. You are welcome to verify this with any of the staff of the New York Penn Station or 9th Avenue locations over the last 4+ years. I hate being so angry at you. But I am. WeWork's behavior to members since mid March has been an unforgivable disgrace.\n",

I also sent a reminder emails on the same in Mar 2020 itself. Thats the best I can do as a client. I never heard back from Wework but since businesses closed down by that time followed by Wework layoff news, I felt Wework and its staff must have a business reason for not responding to my email.  So, by putting my last date At Wework as 12-May, I am hoping not to see any unnecessary rental billed or outstanding against my name.  Regards Sumit\n",

      "-1 0.033 I think your actions during the pandemic have been deplorable. As a young company who literally just signed the lease in February, being forced to pay rent when LA is in a stay home order is unfathomable and irresponsible. My business did not use WeWork for mail, so there is no reason outside of self-serving purposes to not put a program in place to alleviate the burden on small businesses. Couple that with lack of insight into how COVID potentially affected WeWork locations (the forums going nuts on this)...this is how WeWork will be remembered.\n",

      "-1 0.04 Considering the crisis, you could have been more flexible with rent especially considering that many of your locations are in cities with strict lockdowns and legally people cannot be using the buildings. I unfortunatley think that this will lose you a lot of repeat customers.\n",

      "-1 0.032 I had a very good experience in my 2+ years at WeWork.  Having a desk and place to come each day did wonders for my productivity.  But the current pandemic situation is such that I don't see myself coming commuting from the suburbs into NYC for the foreseeable future.  As such, I need to end my contract and stop my company paying for something we are not using.  I hope to be in a position to re-engage at some point in mid to late 2021 and have a desk again.    Thanks for everything!\n",

      "177 0.069 I waited more than 2 months for our last retainer/deposit to be refunded. Given COVID-19, WeWork should allow members to move out immediately and should focus on returning the retainers quicker. Leaves a poor taste in one's mouth.\n",

      "-1 0.033 I am not happy with how WeWork cope with COVID19. Members are forced to pay for the membership, potentially leading to people wanting to back to WeWork against all medical advises.

Also, the communication from our account manager has been very poor.\n",

      "178 0.037 Due to Covid-19 we have no idea when we'll be able to work collectively in an office again.  It doesn't make sense for us to enter into a long term deal with this uncertainty.  We're an asset to the WeWork's food-focused building at 511 w 25th street (we're one of the best direct-to-consumer food companies in NYC), and we were open to committing to a 6 month term post Covid-19, with a couple of reasonable pricing break suggestions.\n",
      "-1 0.065 I very much liked the team.  My desire to move out is to exercise the short term nature of my commitment and why I signed up originally.  I paid a premium for this.  To consider returning, WeWork will need to adjust footprints, cleaning, etc. to be COVID safe.\n",

      "45 0.0 The Preston Center building was very nice but you should have made arrangements for free (or reduced cost) parking; I came from Legacy West where there was ample parking, and it was free; I have been paying $125 a month here at Preston Center and there 2-3 empty floors in the parking garage.

He is the sole shining light and has been on multiple occasions throughout my dealings with the team at Houston Galleria. Jonathan is the only reason that my ratings of WeWork and my likelihood to return is not a zero but is a “1” instead. The community team at WeWork Houston Galleria, on the other hand, is incredibly sub-par and it is a blessing to be complete with my membership at that space. I will never return. I will never recommend that space to anyone until a complete overhaul of their team and their attitude towards getting “results” for their clients (which are the members) is adjusted.\n",

Jonathan is the only reason that my ratings of WeWork and my likelihood to return is not a zero but is a “1” instead. The community team at WeWork Houston Galleria, on the other hand, is incredibly sub-par and it is a blessing to be complete with my membership at that space. I will never return. I will never recommend that space to anyone until a complete overhaul of their team and their attitude towards getting “results” for their clients (which are the members) is adjusted.\n",

There was no leadership when there was leadership needed, and the issues fell to the community team, who had no jurisdiction to make decisions, and could only apologize because their managers wouldn't take a phone call.

      "180 0.0 We understand WeWork's business relies on customers paying for continued office use. However we found the handling of Covid19 was poor. Our office size would not allow for 1.5m social distancing, therefore we did not use it after mid/late March to adhere to Government advice. We also noticed LESS staff around from this point to clean high risk 'communal' areas, which was unsettling. We were then told that WeWork was not offering any financial support (i.e. lower costs, ability to reduce membership without extending terms etc). We then received an email mid May saying 'as discussed' WeWork had provided the following support. Of which the contents of the email was different to the phone call we received. We were told via email we must pay full rates or risk ending contract, notwithstanding we told our 'community manager' that we did not intend to pay the fees and instead was happy for the fees to come out of our bond. We were never told that was NOT going to be acceptable. Overall the experience made us feel like the WeWork 'community' was not a community at all. It was WeWork management passing down messages and not at all working with the community. If the treatment was more in line with our clients' experiences with landlords then we would be much more likely to return at a later date and speak better of WeWork to our clients/networks. It's unfortunate this won't be the case.\n",

Some of that was understandable, but it really changed the culture and the feel of the place.  With COVID, we also noted that there seemed to be issues with getting community members to wear masks, adding to preexisting issues with cleaning.  When the pandemic hit, it seemed like WeWork stayed open in order to keep making money without regard for the organizations who were also harmed by the pandemic.  It seemed like there was a rush to reopen, with specious reasons, and that not enough thought or planning was put into really thinking about how to keep us safe (and our building had a COVID case!).  There was also a feeling that the company lacked empathy and was particularly selfish and self-serving, even at the potential cost of our health and safety.  Frankly, we won't return to a WeWork unless we absolutely have to because we don't trust the company to do what's best for us, and that lack of trust is fatal.\n",

The original numbers suggested that you guys were not willing to negotiate that much - and to your credit, you did offer \"moving to a smaller room\" as an alternative, but at that point, you've already lost my business.    In all honesty, what you guys offer isn't truly unique anymore and there are competitors out there with newer buildings and better amenities.

Working in a windowless environment also isn't appealing at this moment. WeWork has always treated me fairly and respectfully, and I enjoyed developing good relationships with the friendly community and cleaning staff, and the convenience of using conference rooms and workspaces in other buildings, as needed. I especially also appreciated the mailroom service, which was so convenient. Thank you for everything! I will miss working there as a fulltime tenant.

I don't understand why they think I will be interested in extending the term when I paid three months for nothing.  I know a few small business owners, and they told me that other co-work spaces (i.e. Industrious) are willing to negotiate fees during the COVID-19 period.

I will be staying at WeWork on a hot desk basis.  I will say however that my client (Florida based company with a presence in NYC) had a lot of difficulties with WeWork in NYC.  And, at times, WeWork functions like the \"Wizard of Oz\" with decisions being made by a faceless \"management\" behind the scenes that is cold-hearted at times.  Senior management should not hide but should be known to members.  Sometimes Chloe and other leads are powerless and the powers \"that be\" act like the Wizard (i.e., big and powerful behind the curtain).  Not good.   Be more interested in members from a senior management standpoint.  I cannot emphasize this any more.\n",

We repeatedly requested our rent to be put on hold during the pandemic, as we were unable to use our office space during the government's lockdown measures. This was denied, instead we were offered commitment terms with lowered rent. We asked whether our building's A/C filters were being upgraded to HEPA standards and we didn't get a clear answer from the building. As a result, we are unable to foresee when we'll be able to safely return to the office, so it doesn't make sense for us to keep paying premium pricing for office space we are unable to use. We were disappointed with WeWork's pandemic policies that were surprisingly unfriendly to its tenants which are mostly small businesses, freelancers or startups. Other co-working spaces in NYC proactively closed down and put rents on hold starting March.

These things combined with the fact that the initially promised amenities of the building (food court, gym, bike storage) still aren't a thing, and the fact that there's still construction/fire alarm testing/etc going on nearly every week means that the value for money isn't quite there.

      "177 0.163 I submitted my move out request on May 1st 2020 thinking I gave my one month notice and would be able to move out June 1st, 2020. I later discovered I have to give one calendar months notice and cannot move out till the end of June which is basically 60 days instead of 30. Had I submitted my request hours earlier on April 31st I would have been able to move out at the end of May. The calendar month notice is sneaky way of getting people locked in longer.  I submitted a request to see if there is any flexibility in allowing me to move out at the end of May as I had planned or pay the extra day and received this response from Matt Worley. \"Good Morning Patrick,   Leadership has chosen not to budge in this case.  In staying to the letter of the law in the agreement, the earliest you can move out and still get your Service Retainer back would be June 30th.\"   I understand that you can hold me to this as technically its in the agreement but was hoping WeWork was able to look at the situation and think outside the box for a second and realize this is ridiculous. Every company has the flexibility to grant exceptions and WeWork clearly chose not to and wants to keep as much money as possible. Its not the money I am concerned with but more of the principal and lack of flexibility from upper management.   There were several times the internet went out while I was working and I didn't complain once. WeWork was renting out the common space shooting a movie and I wasn't able to use it and I didn't complain once. There are signs all over the furniture in the common areas don't sit here because of COVID. I thought part of what I was paying for was the ability to use the common space on the 23rd floor. I didn't complain about this either. I ask for a little flexibility in return and was rejected.   I gave WeWork a chance to be flexible and work this out and said I would pay the extra day but you chose money over customer service.\n",

Please discuss this confusion with Omnia as I know that she will be able to confirm that our end date of our contract still remained the same as the original membership agreement.

This was an administrative error on our end. Sincere apologies for that. Your move out will be processed for the end of July as previously discussed.

      "157 0.04 Since working from home due to Covid I can see how much better it is. I need to make one or two confidential calls a day and absolutely can’t do that from WeWork! Surely sound proof phone booths is a basic requirement for office space. Also, I gave up tryjng to get the printing to work. Helpdesk tried to help but it never got resolved and shouldn’t have been tricky. The sign up process was a nightmare with multiple emails demanding payment which turned out (when I questioned them) to be wrong. Overall, a very unprofessional experience. Even trying to fill out this form took 4 browsers across two devices to eventually find a ststem on wgich this form worked\n",
      "151 0.04 First, the front of house staff are phenomenal. Since I started renting at WeWork in 2017 they have found ways to accommodate my needs and concerns. They are the MAJOR reason that I stayed at WeWork for as many years as I have rather than shopping around for all the different coworking spaces. Some reasons I left are because (1) the offices have very poor sound proofing. You can hear someone talking softly in the office next door. And during my 3 years at We Work I had two noisy neighbors and that is why your wonderful staff helped me move to a different office that would be quieter. They also provided a rug and a sound absorbing painting to hang on the wall. When they moved me to a different office they walked me through the entire floor plan to try to figure out the best place for me (to find neighbors that are quiet, or to find an office that didn't have neighbors on both sides).  When  I was working with Henry who isn't based in the MN office, I don't think he really understood my concerns or that the specific office mattered a lot. Basically I don't feel like my office needs were taken into consideration. It just came down to a dollar amount... which also wasn't cost competitive given the number of competitors and what they have to offer. (2) I hate the \"fish bowl\" feel of the offices. That makes having confidential documents on my computer screen very challenging (and I also think this contributes to the sound issues).The office I am moving to at Regus has 3 walls which I prefer. (3) the price for the teenie tiny 1 person office is much higher than what I was able to find elsewhere. I really liked the size of my current office and I think that that office is worth ~$450-500 and not the amount that you all are charging  (4) I don't like that you removed many of the perks that made WeWork appealing to me. For one, I no longer see a chat option to easily contact the front of house staff in my building. That is odd and annoying. I don't understand why you would make it more difficult for me to contact them with concerns or questions that I have. Also, I see that you removed the feature for me to post a message to the WeWork community (both only within my building or across all WeWork locations). That is a HUGE disappointment. One reason I found WeWork appealing was because I wanted to find different companies to work with. I used that feature and I was very happy with it. I also don't like how other community features like local beers on tap were removed. I feel like there are a lot of changes that have happened in the past year and I can't say that I am happy with any of them (other than that the staff at Mpls remained fantastic through the 3 years I was here).\n",

I never used the printer or drank the beer or coffee or attended the hundreds of pointless self help or nutrition sessions. I was still hit with the price increase.

It feels like no one wanted my business, the local team felt too cool to sell me anything or to be interested in retaining me as a a customer.  When I was looking for the office I had to follow up with the rep to get a proposal for several weeks. No one every came during the 1 year to see how my experience was and when it was time to renew they offered a new effective rate that was about 40% more than what I am currently paying.  I experience this as if no one is looking at the business. That experience is reinforced by the high number of empty spaces in my floor, there are more vacancies than occupancies. I can't see why they would not be more interested in my business and retaining me as client. It seems so basic.

I am however very disappointed in the WeWork Leadership's handling of the Covid crisis I have not been able to use my membership since mid March and have paid in full of 1.5 months of no service. As I feel WeWork have not met their side of the agreement I am with holding payment for May and will do the same for June. WeWork should not be charging me the full cost and offering no service particularly when you are benefiting from Government support including both Furlough and Rates Grants and rebates, while paying no UK Tax, along with significantly reducing your costs for cleaning, food and beverage, stationary, activities and events. I did not expect to pay no costs in these 3.5 months, I did however expect to pay reduced costs without being asked to commit to a further term. Particularly when I had already been working with the Edinburgh team as there was a sound proofing issue with my office which meant that I couldn't use it for my business. I had offered to remain as a member using hotdesking.

      "177 0.078 Shalom, I have just filled out the online form to terminate my membership as I’m not able to use the premises because of government regulations designed to curb the spread of the corona-virus (covid-19).  You indicated a net+30 cancellation policy without any discount to be applied to the rent of April 2020 despite the crisis situation. I understand from Amit Peretz that this rent would be charged to the service retainer and that you are waiving the 10% fine – which is appreciated.  However, the above is not sufficient and I request that you either entirely cancel the charge for April 2020 or that we terminate the lease with immediate effect as of today.  As you well know, there are government regulations in place since mid-March that ban gatherings of more than ten people and instructions for people not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. This means that by law I should not make use of the premises and that you are not providing many of your regular services.  In such a situation, the law in Israel allows for rental payments to be suspended and/or for immediate termination of the leases. As a lawyer I could refer you amongst others to section 15 of the Rental and Borrowing Law and section 18 of the Contract Law (Remedies for Breach of Contract) and section 43 of the Contract Law (General Part). In any case, as long as a decision is made during April offering a discount or cancellation of the rent and / or about the possibility of terminating the contract immediately to any other member, I request that such a decision will be applied to me as well and the diffrence or the entire amount will be returned to me.  Wishing you all good health and hope we will be able to renew our cooperation in happier times.\n",

One of the following: (1) A message from the landlord stating that if WeWork gets kicked out, we'd have some period of time to retrieve our stuff (2) An excerpt from the lease contract showing that members would have the right to  retrieve stuff in the event of a default/eviction or (3) A legal opinion from an attorney showing that Florida law would give members the right to retrieve their stuff (if such a right exists).\n",

You would only offer a discount if committed to a longer period of commitment to a service that was already not working for me and not let me move to a space that would work. If find this inflexibility and the fact that you are charging in full for services that you are not delivering unacceptable, particularly while you access UK Government support and don't pay UK tax. I would have been very satisfied with a reasonable discount over these 3 months but you have left your teams in a very difficult position. I am currently withholding my May and June payments until I get a satisfactory resolve as you have currently broken your agreement with me by not fulfilling the services included in the agreement. I am happy to pay an reasonable reduced fee for these months. I would also like to highlight that the sound proofing in the offices in Edinburgh is poor and I was already working with the team to look at how I could use We Work differently before the Pandemic on which they were very helpful within the restrictions imposed.\n",

As one gets older, it's already hard enough to make time for friends and family, so building relationships and trust with people, from the ground up, where you have little in common outside of a shared workspace is tiring and feels a bit pointless.   Being remote, none of my colleagues work at that location, so socializing wasn't easy for me where most other people had automatic pals in the office.   While I can see how WeWork could be good for individuals working for themselves and groups of all sizes, it honestly kinda sucked for me. As a lone employee outpost, where the rest of my company is spread around the world, I'm happier and (perhaps ironically) feel more connected at home.  Your mission says \"...We wanted to build a community. A place you join as an individual, 'me', but where you become part of a greater 'we'...\" I never experienced that at WeWork. Maybe that's because I already felt that 'we'-ness, both outside of work with my community and with my colleagues, working remotely from home. Good luck.\n",

We will no longer be using offices (and paying rent) and therefore you can deactivate access card for everyone.

It’s unconscionable that WeWork would risk their employees health and lives so they could collect its fees.   I cannot do business with organization on this premise.   Let me share with you the good that is going on -   We are a PR agency that serves media and entertainment / high tech. Just about every client we work with was offering their customers \"free services, free tools etc..\" to ensure people/business can continue on.  For some of our customers who need help during this time, we cut our rates to help them get to the other side.    We have one other co-working space in Santa Barbara called Kiva.  The moment the shelter in place came - they sent an email asking everyone to grab what they needed. That they were in it with us and would not be charging for April.

To top that, the move out process was messy as I had to make multiple calls to confirm my move out date since I still kept receiving emails about my upcoming bill (for may). So, to summarize, regardless of the fact that the office was not useable during Covid-19 period, I feel that we work unnecessarily charged me for 1.5 months (0.5 month during move in and 1 month during move out).\n",

      "-1 0.035 It is very disappointing to be leaving WeWork on such negative terms after such a positive experience. In my first year at WeWork I saw my company grow from one person to 7 full time employees and a number of remote part time. I envisioned WeWork as a long time solution that would allow my company to grow incrementally within a space and environment we were very happy with.  Like many, Covid brought tough times on my business as the entertainment industry came to a stand still. The first month payment I did not mind handling as this caught us all off guard. But to be charged the full rent for three months that I am not able to use my space due to stay at home orders - not to mention the inability to have employees in due to social distancing - was quite disappointing. To have reached out for assistance from WeWork in this time and received no options other than extending my lease or paying the full price was also a big letdown, and very detrimental to my confidence in my company's relationship with WeWork moving forward.  Beyond that, our WeWork was even shutdown when an employee contracted the virus, yet there was not even a pro-rated refund for this time. When I finally went into the office to gather some belongings, the majority of the amenities we are promised were not available.  All in all, I feel taken advantage of. At a time where WeWork is also looking for rent relief from landlords, it is very disappointing to not find better understanding from a company I felt I had built a lasting relationship with. For what it's worth, I very much appreciated working with Graham, who handled client relations in a difficult time with great tact. I just wish the decision makers above would have a better understanding of the negative lasting impact their current handling of this situation is having.  I know that once the entertaining industry is back up and running my business will continue to grow exponentially. I had always pictured us moving into one of the large corner offices at our WeWork. Now I'll be finding a new co-working alternative to grow my business in, and I could not in good conscious recommend WeWork to others after seeing how poorly they take care of good long term tenants. I hope WeWork survives this time, but unfortunately you have lost a loyal customer in the process.\n",

I was always greeted with a smile and a warm welcome. Having said that, I am disappointed in the enforcement of the 30 day move out policy at this time. I executed and understand the member agreement fully but, feel the current situation is out of my control and should be considered an exception. I have been laid off from work (as have many folks around the world) and I am not considered an essential employee. My membership at WeWork is no longer needed and furthermore I am not allowed to utilize the space regardless based on CDC and governmental regulations. Based on WeWorks Values stating: “We are in this together. This is a team effort. We always look out for one another. We have empathy, we know we’re all human, and know we can’t do any of this alone;” From my prospective, it does not appear that WeWork is looking out for one another and that does not seem very empathetic to me.

They have been committed to providing a fruitful member experience. We would have loved to remain members, however the treatment of rentals amidst COVID, and unwillingness to reduce rentals moving ahead (which is reflective of the market reality in BKC) left us compelled to move out due to a board directive.

The lack of customer centricity when it matters, leaves us with a bitter taste at the end of this engagement.\n",

We also did not have working HVAC for over two years (which prompted our move to our current space.) We've been more than accommodating of all of WeWork's quirks and failures to provide contracted services, but I guess since WeWork is going out of business all you can do is drop any appearances of working to help members to squeeze out any last bit of money from members in hopes of keeping the doors open for a few more months... best of luck! hope other members receive better treatment.\n",

Also, the ability to easily move to a better space as one becomes available.   You make it very difficult to \"upgrade\" from the center seat to the aisle (so to speak).

Unfortunately, no one was willing to help and simply said “it’s out of my control, it’s up to corporate.” While I understand that WeWorks had to remain open for essential businesses, non-essential small businesses like me were overlooked and mistreated. My local government made it imperative not to go into the office for two months, yet I was still charged a full two months rent by a shared coworking space (WeWork) that avoided any and all creativity in attempting to find solutions. For those reasons, I will never return. The facility and the local staff were great. But the corporate policies in place will neglect and drive away small businesses like me.\n",

I'm disappointed that WeWork would not temporarily suspend my lease during the pandemic, and that I'll still to have to pay through July in spite of everything. It reflects that WeWork has a lack of understanding of what tenants are going through right now. It makes me much less likely to return to WeWork once the pandemic has ended.

It took too much time and energy to finally agree a reduction in rent, which should have been offered naturally at the beginning of the pandemic. Ultimately causing a lot of stress and disruption to a small business.  The entire team worked from home during the entire rental contract period.  As you also know, we do feel WeWork has been profiteering from members in Corsham St., not paying the building landlords, but charging members, ultimately forcing a move into a building we did not want and need. The service and support received (except Tom & to a degree Georgina) was well below the rates invoice and our expectations.

My company has been fortunate to call 111 W Illinois home for the entire time it's been open, and since I have been a member since day 1, I thought WeWork could have showed a little more compassion by being more transparent on the plans.  I would like to say that the people that have been day to day managers of 111 W Illinois have been great and I'm lucky to know all of them.   I haven't been as impressed with the people who are higher up at WeWork, and I think the higher ups at WeWork could have shown a lot more leadership and transparency.

In fact, the only communication that I have received from WeWork corporate, an email from your CEO, Mr. Sandeep Mathrani last week, made no mention of the obvious elephant in the room - WeWork's ongoing expectation of rent payments by their members with no relief.

Timing has made it wise for us to put on hold until we know what's realistic for our needs, and allowed in the new normal. BTW only hiccup has been the pass around among our \"account managers\" as we exited, in that there didn't seem to be someone who knew a) what we needed for our business and how WW could fit in b) seemed to understand the NYS requirements for back to work in the time of COVID (you can't say our office spaces would accommodate 41 people - it would completely need to be reconfigured).\n",

Instead of help, we were told we could lease a 2nd office to create more room. We were not given any opportunity to pause payments and extend our lease, amortize rent, or any option that would help us during the crisis - instead, all offers were in favor of WW making more money off us.  Our lease began in January, we hired our team in February, and they used the office for a few weeks then we were shut down because of the pandemic. It would have been great if WW would have acknowledged that we have paid a full year for an office we used for less than one month. Not the end of the world but wasn't the best experience from that point of view. The staff is friendly and the space is beautiful, we wish we could have experienced more of the environment and services.\n",

All of the exploits and issues with WeWork being picked up by news definitely made things feel mired in controversy. The lead paint issue in some phone booths was particularly disheartening. Ultimately, we are quite unhappy with the fact that we had to pay for 3 months of rent for a space we legally were not supposed to work out of for 3 months per the Governor's stay-at-home order for non-essential employees. We do not anticipate using a space in the near future, until there's more certainty about containing the virus and the virus not mutating or there being a second wave due to increased spikes in other states.\n",

The corporate position of \"you're in contract so tough shit\" was narrow minded. The net result of this policy is that you'll likely maintain your customer base in the short term as you have people by the balls. However, once these contracts end you're likely to see an exodus. The result is that you will maintain cashflow in the short term but cause a tremendous dip in forecastable revenue. Combine this with the reduction of your sales force and it simply seems that your hyper aggressive approach is going to undermine your business model and cause untold amounts of damage.\n",

I asked for an email to go out to all tenants about staying home if sick or have a cough. Nothing was done so we are leaving to a more secure space where we can have more control on who enters the workspace.  We also asked to upgrade to the 4th floor retainer fee increased significantly for a 6 month membership. So we opted out due to increased costs in an unprotected space.\n",

I've also encountered two members at WeWork that lack integrity and I don't wish to be associated with them.

JustCo's pricing is about 70% of WeWork, and I have offered to stay if you match their price but you have declined.  There is no way you will recover the money I have offered because the whole place is empty.   My tenancy adds no incremental cost to your business and yet you are going to decline to take money which will drop straight to your bottom line.   I guess this management behavior does explain why Wework is in such bad shape financially.\n",

      "146 0.034 I have had a 3-4 person office at WeWork for 3 years and had planned to re-rent in the fall after business rebounds. However WeWork is only offering discounts for the state mandated shut-down to those tenants continuing on beyond the shut-down. I paid full rent though the state mandated shut-down even though I was not able to receive services and even though WeWork was able to scale down their expenses during this period. There were no TGIMs, no drinks on tap, less staff support, less supplies. We will not see any of those savings passed onto us - they may not have been much, but the acknowledgment of this by the company would have been meaningful. I understand that WeWork still paid their landlords, but the services savings should have been passed down to ALL tenants paying full rent during the shutdown, not just those continuing leases. Other community work spaces are offering these discounts - even if small, and are thereby strengthening the relationships with their tenants. Before this experience, I thought highly of WeWork, but now will not recommend WeWork and will continue to tell this story to the many people who knew we were at WeWork.\n",

From a safety standpoint and following the guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is simply impossible to expose anyone to the virus and furthermore with knowledge of members who tested positive in our building.  WMT is a small business and unlike large enterprises, we are not afforded the opportunity to navigate losses and costs during this pandemic which are far worse than many business verticals.\n",

We will no longer be using offices (and paying rent) and therefore you can deactivate access card for everyone. Per Kyle's email of April 9, Service retainer on account is £30,720.00 and \"Total Remaining on Commitment\" was £40,062.80.  Since then we have paid £8.6k for May, which essentially pretty much offsets remaining balance with the service retainer. Please acknowledge receipt of this email. Thanks for all your help and hope to reconnect with Wework when situation improves. Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else from Jahia.

      "152 0.02 I want to state that my ratings have nothing to do with the on site community teams. We loved all the community team members. They, along with the spaces and amenities, were the highlight of our WeWork experience.   Our Story: We started on with WeWork 3 years ago, we were very happy with WeWork until Covid hit. Though we would have liked for WeWork to decrease our rent as a result of being mandated to stay at home, we realized through many back and forth exchanges that they would not accommodate our request.   Instead, WeWork offered to move us to a location closer to home, to which we accepted. Despite the new location being at what seemed to be about 80% vacancy, WeWork chose a space for us to move into for the final 5 months of our lease. WeWork did not allow us to pick a space. Instead WeWork picked a space for us on the first floor of the building. We were wary of this because we have a lot of expensive equipment and we didn't like being at street level in the city. WeWork assured us that the building has 24/7 security on site and our office should be safe.   One week after moving into the space, the building was broken into twice in one night. Somebody tried to take a crowbar to our office but luckily didn't gain access. We were very upset about this and demanded to be moved.   WeWork then moved us to a 6 person space on the 3rd floor. We were very happy with this accommodation   &gt&gt&gt This is where the story should end. However I believe this is the point where WeWork lost us as members.  After a couple of weeks being in the new, 6-person space, WeWork overcharged our account $4,500. We noticed this and contacted WeWork. It was seemingly impossible to get in touch with an actual, live individual from the WeWork billing team. In fact, it was even impossible to get a timely response via email. We were forced to files support tickets every day for a month in order to receive our money back. Even the community team had trouble reaching the billing team. This is unacceptable, to overcharge a company $4,500, and have us struggle for a month, just guessing and hoping, filing support tickets, unable to talk to a live billing team rep, in order to get our money back.  ON TOP OF THIS, WeWork tried to get us to move out of the 6-person space that they moved us into because of \"security reasons\". There are literally 15 people in this entire building and WeWork is worried about getting us out of our space for security reasons.  WeWork hassled us for the past 2 months, back and forth trying to get us out of our space. On one day people would say we could stay, the next they say we need to move. This internal confusion was a complete nightmare for us.   For these reasons we decided to move on from WeWork.\n",

Almost every other company I know has worked with their customers to give relief and find a solution given the unprecedented situation. WeWork made it very clear that they value short term cash over the safety, well being, and retention of their customers. As reported in the news, they haven't been paying rent to some landlords but are still charging tenants at a time when we have orders to stay at home? I've been a loyal customer for about 2 years - and they insisted on keeping my $1,500 instead of keeping me as a long term customer? Strange.\n",

      "-1 0.03 One of the reasons I initially went with WeWork was because of its network of offices nationally and internationally, as I was expecting to travel a lot for business in the future. This is obviously delayed now. However, the one chance I had before the travel ban to check out another WeWork office was in Brisbane. It was absolutely useless as a work space (for me as a visitor). Half the seating areas did not have power plugs, most of the ones that did were broken - so most people were cramped onto 2-3 desks. The one space I did find, after spending half an hour trying to find a suitable spot, I had to leave after ten minutes as the noise was unbearable. Having a ping pong and a airhocky table in an open plan work space might look cool, but seems idiotic to me. Having my own serviced office is fine but if the Brisbane experience was any indication of what it means to be a visitor to WeWork offices, then it's nowhere near good enough.\n",

However, I was continuously billed the entire time although the office was locked down and I legally could not work or go into the office given the nature of my business.  This lack of concern for the tenant and well being of your customers was very disheartening and made my decision not to continue very easy.  This was a difficult situation for everyone, but to continue billing clients without an option for freezing the accounts was not appreciated considering I was not given the ability to use the office.\n",
      "177 1.0 I'm disappointed with your team and the exit process. I  would have expected your team to have inform me about the exit form that I had to sign one month prior to leaving. I informed your team of my intension to leave in December 2019. I was told about my commitment till end of January. So I was with the assumption that once I get your request to renew my contract in January I would not renew it. Till last week I was not told about the Exit Form. I would have expected your team to have mentioned it at some point as I was in touch with them since December. Now I have to pay 2 additional months of rent for the office I do not need. Legally you may be right, I would a expected Wework team to have reminded me of these as your team handles it on a regular basis.\n",

I have paid all the rent asked since March, even though I have not used my office once. Now I need to move my belongings out in December when I would like to return to the office in Feb. If I have to move out in December it will make it a lot harder for me to return, as why would I bother when I have moved everything out and can work from home? Makes sense for everyone to allow me to leave my belongings in the office for a month (the floor is practically empty - most of the offices have been vacated, so WeWork doesn't need my tiny office for someone new as there are plenty of offices available for others) and that way I would return in February and you could continue to make money out of me.

As you know, we are in the face to face events business and we have no idea when we will be able to hold another in-person event.  Our largest event of the year March 9-11, 2020 had to be cancelled. We have been denied insurance coverage for the event by our cancellation insurance provider because communicable disease was an exclusion in our policy and the hotel we had the event scheduled at is trying to collect almost $200,000 in cancellation fees as they have denied our force majeure claim because the hotel did not have to close yet at that time.  There is no revenue currently coming in and I have to cut all expenses including cancellation of our WeWork membership. This email regretfully serves as our cancellation notice. We paid March and April member fees but will not be able to pay May and June.  When I read on April 8 in the Wall Street Journal that WeWork had stopped paying rent to many landlords, I decided to remove all of our belongings out of our space as I was concerned we may be locked out in a dispute between you and the landlord. Our office space is vacant.  I'd greatly appreciate it if you could return our $3,000 deposit and let me know where I should mail our key cards and office keys - to you at 300 Park Ave or to another location. I have everything ready and just need to know where to mail it.\n",

The response was slow and inefficient when i know competitors lowered the rents 25-50% during this period and all other stakeholders and service providers lowering overheads during this crises.

It is indeed a very challenging time, but all of us at every level of society now have an opportunity to step up and demonstrate leadership (see Classpass or Nike). Wework has been missing the mark thus far but hopefully will start to do the right thing moving forward for it's members, employees and the communities that it serves. I wish everyone safety and best of luck!\n",

Aaron, Adam, Jillian, and Macy were exceptional to my team. Had it not been for them, we would have left a lot sooner.

      "177 0.152 Was overall a nice experience, a pity management is not making the required concessions during the coronavirus. You indicated a net+30 cancellation policy without any discount to be applied to the rent of April 2020 despite the precarious situation. I understand from Amit that this rent would be charged to the service retainer and that you are waiving the 10% fine – which is appreciated. However, the above is not sufficient and I request that that you either entirely cancel the charge for April 2020 or that we terminate the lease with immediate effect as of today.  As you well know, there are government regulations in place since mid-March that ban gatherings of more than ten people and instructions for people not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. This means that by law I should not make use of the premises and that you are not providing many of your regular services.  In such a situation, the law in Israel allows for rental payments to be suspended and/or for immediate termination of the leases. As a lawyer I could refer you amongst others to section 15 of the Rental and Borrowing Law, section 18 of the Contract Law (Remedies for Breach of Contract) and section 43 of the Contract Law (General Part). Wishing you all good health and hope we will be able to renew our cooperation in happier times.\n",

I really can't understand how that doesnt result in a saving. You may offer great deals to new members but you have treated existing loyal ones disgracefully.

I regularly had to reach out to ask for these services. This really did not make me feel confident in the level of cleaning once the pandemic had started, before the stay-at-home order.

Overall this was particularly poor, both from WeWork understanding the nature and severity of the problem (job interviews took place in this room), to WeWork owning the problem, to WeWork giving us a sense that it was actually a priority. Eventually after 9 months we stopped chasing the problem and as expected nothing was ever done, nor was it mentioned again. This is probably the lasting impression of WeWork.\n",

We provided notification on June 1.  I still have yet to be asked if there's anything that WeWork could do to adjust our membership, office space or otherwise provide a reasonable avenue for us to renew.  I am greatly disappointed with the customer service and overall management of WeWork at 80 M St, and WeWork policies in general.  This is on top of the fact that we have been paying rent during a pandemic for office space that we have largely been unable to use due to city quarantine guidelines.

We paid our rent in full - haven't even used the space since 3/12/2020 but paid regardless - and now we are being charged for the month of June 2020 as well simply because we aren't renewing the term due to COVID. You can be sure that once COVID is less of a concern and we're ready to lease new space we will seek out one of your competitors because this has left a terrible taste in our mouths and we are disgusted that WeWork would behave this way during a crisis.

I found it VERY unprofessional to receive a move out form without even receiving an answer to my email. I’m very disappointed by the complete lack of understanding / empathy for a critical situation.  Missing Amanda: she was a great community manager. Also checking in to see if you can reconsider move out day on June 30: if Oliver would have responded to me in a timely manner last week, he would have received my notice by Friday.   See my original email to Oliver below.   While I am making my evaluations, I wanted to see if you were open to the following:   I will come in one last time to get my mail & checks as soon as it is safe (no riots in the area) – hopefully next week or the following. We will freeze the membership / payments until riots & COVID are over (happy to give you the digital key card and the actual key back – both mine and Susanna’s). I will set up mail forwarding to my place so your team doesn’t get inconvenienced with mail. Obviously, the month of June will be paid. The amount should be $1,460 as per my agreement with Amanda. As soon as the situation is safe, we will resume the rent at $1,460, which is what it was agreed with Amanda before her role changed. Obviously, if you need the space because you have someone else interested on it, I can move out in 48 hours from when I receive your notice. I saw most of the offices around my space (but the one next to me) vacated so I assume currently there isn’t a high demand, and there are plenty of options for future tenants.   Would you be open to something like that?   If not, sadly I would need to cancel my agreement ASAP – and I am hopeful you can honor the cancellation to start as early as July 1st, since the earliest we were able to connect by phone was yesterday an di promptly brought up the issue as soon as I received the invoice. I will move out as soon as it is safe, for sure before the end of the month.   Lastly, I see a pending payment for $4,400 for the month of June – kindly confirm this would be $1,460 or I would need to call AMEX to cancel the charge right away.   Let me know.\n",

Also, if there was an option to sign up for a number of days on an ad hoc basis, then I would use that all the time when I'm traveling. I often travel to client locations and need a space to work out of when I'm not meeting with clients, and it would be incredibly helpful to be able to pay for a day at a time at different locations around the world.

Therefore, it does affect our personal willingness to recommend WeWork. On another note, we had many issues with billing not monitoring our payments. We had to reach out several times to get matters sorted as we were receiving emails re late fees when this wasn't the case.

Many of us watched all of our income for the foreseeable future disappear in a matter of a few days. Fortunately companies like Quickbooks, Adobe, American Express, Equinox, etc. recognize the toll that something like this pandemic can take on small businesses, and they all extended a helping hand. While I appreciate that WeWork didn't activate the rent increase that had been proposed for March 1, which would have been absolutely tone deaf on your part, it was disappointing to see how little regard the company actually has for the 'community' that has supported your growth from the beginning.

But I'm completely unimpressed with WeWork and \"Headquarters\" who seemed blind and insensitive to COVID-19 issues their clients are experiencing. Contracts and jobs evaporated overnight or were put on hold. I work in TV thus the entire industry is on hold. We also have to obey stay-at-home orders from the State thus we can't disobey laws and tell employees to show up to WeWork just because of your lease! Plus local staff said I could get out of my lease without penalty but it was denied by Headquarters. Instead of letting us out of our leases, WeWork used strong arm tactics to hold our rents hostage. And parking costs were totally held hostage. I'm less enthused to return and will let people know what WeWork is really like which is disappointing as I appreciated the time, efforts and energy of local staff. Hopefully once this pandemic will end, we will all see more clearly.\n",

WeWork had it in its power to help the small businesses at their locations and they have appeared to drag their feet and do nothing meaningful to support us. However, during the crisis WeWork seems to have made it a priority to auto-charge my credit card at every opportunity! I do not appreciate the appearance that WeWork is filling its pockets at the expense of small businesses and not providing any meaningful support to help us survive through the crisis. WeWork's lack of empathy and support during the crisis has severely damaged the WeWork brand in my eyes. I have carefully grown my company to have a high quality brand and I cannot have it associated with a WeWork brand that clearly has not done enough to support its long-term members during the crisis.\n",

Our request to honour the original move out date was refused.

I looked forward to seeing themn every day and they defined the experience of community in our space more than anything else.  The downside, and the things that are likely to make me choose a competitor who may not present the same difficulties are: -time table for giving notice and vacating, basically it having to occur on the 1st or you're stuck with a full additional month -not being able to send a deposit back to a credit card when a credit was used to pay the deposit.  This makes no sense to me, and also caused significant problems for me in obtaining account info from my employer.  Since the move out form can not be submitted without the account info, it added stress to an already stressful situation.  Also, you charge a higher deposit amount when a deposit is paid with a credit card and you charge a processing fee.  Why do you not provide a higher level of service for something you charge more for?  This is a VERY unsatisfying part of my wework experience.\n",

As we were peaking in NYC and no one was allowed to access office space, there was not one communication from executives to address concerns over rent at a time when small businesses (like many WeWork tenants) were hit.  This parallels knowledge in NYC that banks and landlords were working with buildings to suspend or delay payments, and I'm guessing several wework buildings were part of it.  Yet there was no outreach or support offered to struggling businesses, like mine, to help us bridge the gap.

      "-1 0.031 Our Account Manager Chris Curran did his best to come up with a solution that would work for us, but at the end of the day, unless we were able to stay month to month at a heavily discounted rate or put our membership on some kind of hold until we are back in the office we could not make this work. When we are able to be back in an office physically we will likely re-sign with wework but cannot stomach the cost while we are not using the space.\n",

If this is not possible, unfortunately we have no choice but to cancel.\n",
      "-1 0.032 I loved coming to Wework Aviation House and people like Mahmood. I really enjoyed working there. I think the approach wework took during this COVID-19 time was shocking. Had wework even halved the fee during this time I almost certainly would have extended for another year. Very short sighted. Also the fact larger companies have been assisted with fee's but smaller companies not, is really terrible.\n",
      "177 0.23 After having paid for the last week of March and full month of April 2020 where we did not come to office even for a single day due to a lockdown, I was told that the membership will be paused till June due to COVID 19 and we will reconnect end of June before my credit card with WeWork is charged again.  Unfortunately, my account was charged in July without notifying me or reconnecting. I was told later that the lady who was managing my account had left the organisation and had therefore not reconnected with me.  Creative solutions like pausing the membership or holding the retainer till we return vs. forfeiting the amount were not considered. It feels like WeWork wanted to choose charging the retainer vs. valuing a customer.  Other than is unfortunate situation, the team is good.\n",

We had several WeWork locations globally and was simply asking WeWork to meet us in the middle and help us with our financial hardship.

It is unfortunate that Kenshoo, after being such a consistent and long-standing client has to leave on these terms.\n",

The financial stress losing work and still paying my full membership while not being able to come use my membership due to shelter in place, losing work and having children out of school was frustrating and unsympathetic\n",

That is 5 months of wasted fees and I made formal requests that WeWork provide me 5 additional months at no charge, to begin after I am safe to come back to WeWork.  WeWork declined and as a result I will not due business with WeWork in the future.  WeWork's primary model is month-to-month and I only saved about 5% by locking into a 1 year commitment. I would have gladly for-fitted the 5% savings to be allowed to go month to month and pause from March forward.  This treatment has lost me as a customer in the future and further tarnished WeWork's reputation, I'm afraid.\n",

This USP under the existing circumstances needs to be well thought through, refined and improved. The Seawoods community team is excellent and they go to any extent to address your concern, I am highly recommending them. Somewhere I see that the central management ruins their hard work and WeWork which has a \"We\" at its core suddenly turns to \"I\" at the first hint of adversity, which of course would leave bad-press and bad-mark on its trusting patrons, hard to recover. The central management team (the policymakers) should address this and give strong backing to their front-line community team.\n",

I was legally not allowed, or highly discouraged, from visiting WeWork space for literally the entire duration of my membership. I was pressured into signing a 6-month contract, rather than the month-to-month arrangement I wanted, and repeatedly attempted to reason and find a fair compromise given the circumstances. WeWork showed not even an ounce of understanding or cooperation. I ended up visiting the space on average less than once per month all year, so essentially paid $700+ per visit, which is completely outrageous. In addition, most of the advertised services were not offered, in addition to obvious health risks. Very poor management of the situation.\n",

I haven't been in the office since March 13th and have continued to pay my membership fee even though it is impossible for me to come to the building.  Now that I know my kids will be home for the summer (camp is cancelled) and there is a likelihood they will continue with online school next school year starting in August, I cannot continue to afford to pay my membership fee.

      "-1 0.036 During last months, COVID has affected the core interest to be part of the WW community which is networking. In addition, many services and amenities were removed or limited for months while rent remained the same. Tenants like me have honored our agreement but WW Corp have lacked to notice they have not and kept charging like they have regardless of the savings the have experienced (less costs of inputs/services/etc). It seems like there is a disconnect between the company and the market, where there are a lot of options out there and the company is not fighting for customers. I even brought an option of a 2yrs lease for a large office, paying $5,000/mo and was turned down because WW Corp wanted to have the space open for large corporations and charge $14,000/mo for that space (???) - 4 months later, offices remain empty and some since I joined a year ago. Personnel wise, I thank them all. A++ Emily and the rest (Dan & others) who still are and some that has come and go on their own (some very fast) have been exceptional. Probably a similar situation with Tenants, struggling to keep/retain people. In any case, will see how market conditions (and offers) are once Heights Union WW space opens and hope by them, new Mgmt is in place because there are options with top of the line services charging way below of the current requested rent.\n",

      "-1 0.012 The people at WeWork are fabulous. Love them. I also dig the convenience of a global network and the ability to book a day at a different location when I'm traveling this part is super handy. There are three things that make WeWork feel like not the best fit:  (1) Price of the base office. Given the allotment for extra members, I can understand why this is a value to some people, but I don't need the extra seats. I can get a nicer private office from another provider for much less. (2) Conference room fees. What I do need and use are conference rooms for meeting with small groups of guests. Using this as much as I should would add a few hundred dollars a month. That probably doesn't feel like a lot for someone already dropping $8K on an office, but it would be a 25-30% increase in my monthly fee. I end up not booking rooms and trying to have one-on-one meetings or do things remotely instead...and it's just not efficient. (3) WeWork inevitably feels pretty start-upy which is probably great for start-ups :-) , and I'd prefer a space that has some more small businessness around it.   Just want to make clear that we have LOVED the people working at WeWork here. Sarah, Kat, and Mike McCullen in particular have been fabulous.\n",

I have a dedicated desk which I am physically unable to use without breaking social distancing rules nor putting my other community members at risk. I requested a cancellation in early April for my membership and was told I would need to pay through May 31st because of the 30-day cancellation notification requirement. Essentially, I am being forced to pay for service for the month of May despite not being able to use my desk without violating NYC health guidelines. For a small business similar to many of the clients WeWork services, every dollar we spend counts and we cannot afford to pay for services we are unable to use, in this case a significant cost to our bottom line run rate during these trying times. I am greatly disappointed WeWork was unwilling to allow me to pause / receive credit / avoid my membership cost despite giving adequate notice. Other services we use are accommodating small business clients during this unprecedented times, but WeWork is forcing us to pay a substantial amount for a service that we are not permitted to use.   For full disclosure, I was eventually given a discounted price for the month May after much pushback (50%) thanks to our wonderful and accommodating community manager Jessica, but this is still a cost for which we will not be getting anything in return given I cannot use the office space.\n",

In both of my experiences, the program provided little more than a “Hot Desk” to its members. There were constant technology and communication issues. On multiple occasions, meetings with Labs staff were cancelled on me and never rescheduled. I experienced nonstop billing issues—the Account Manager page in the member portal never worked for me and would only display a blank white page. When this issue was brought to the staffs attention, little was done to remedy the problem. I was told on several occasions that the technology team was working on resolving the error and that a Community Manager would reach out to me to help, which never happened. Lastly, my most recent membership was supposed to be for the month of February 2020. Instead, I’ve been charged not only for February, but for March, April, and May. I’ve reached out to staff several times (yet again) with no resolution.

Our kitchen was always out of stuff, the janitors and the occupants had to share the same area which I am sure was hard for janitorial staff to work.  There should be a back of house kitchen with a dishwasher where they can work without constantly being disrupted.  Dishwasher seemed like a residential set up, not commercial.

The post COVID plans for social distancing and cleaning internally don't inspire confidence. Elevators in our building still don't work nearly 2 years on from building opening.

So when you see it and like it, it’s already gone. Further, our newly renovated building still doesn’t have more than 1-2 (if you’re lucky) working elevators over a year after its opening. Not only is this unprofessional for clients visiting but you can’t service a building of 8 floors and over 2500 people this way. There has been mice problems, power outages and endless noise problems due to poor sound insulation and acoustics in hallways and between offices.

Staff could be surly, extension cables nearly electrocuted my staff, there was a rodent problem, HVAC temperatures were inconsistent at best, kitchen supplies always empty, and the rental rates expensive. Noise pollution from surrounding offices and the hallways was always intensely loud, and the lifts never worked properly from Day 1.

They have been down already 4 times since the lockdown started, at least in some cases due to networking issues (or the latest one: a plug being accidentally kicked out of the socket) which WeWork was responsible for.

      "NOISE: It's extremely loud all the time. For sales teams who have to make calls, it's impossible to find a quiet let alone private place to do their jobs. Hearing someone's calls, word for word, is distracting and should be prevented with proper building procedures. And of course others recommend wearing headphones or earplugs, but that shouldn't be the fix. Expecting people to wear headphones for 5-7 hours a day to drown out noise isn't the solution.\n",
      "LACK OF PRIVACY: Everything is exposed. With so many companies sharing the space you'd think WeWork would've taken into consideration the need for privacy and the ability to keep information confidential. I honestly believe the developers of the building ignored the need for insulation to cut costs. \n",
      "PETTING ZOO: Having a pet-friendly work environment sounds great and all until people abuse the perk and ignore the rules associated with the privilege of bringing a pet to work. Most of the pet owners bring their pets to get attention and have an excuse to leave their desk every 15 mins. They are more of a distraction than a helpmate. Also, everyone shouldn't be forced to be okay with dogs being in the kitchen area. It's unsanitary for them to be where people prepare their lunches and eat. It's more of an Austin thing to see pets where normally public health codes wouldn't allow them and everyone isn't an Austinite. There is also signage informing pet owners to keep their pets on a leash. We've seen dogs have altercations and run up aggressively to other pets when off the leash. There is a lack of enforcement regarding the leash rule so people barely follow it.\n",
      "PARKING: The parking garage is tight and hard to maneuver through. I've also seen some people take up two spaces to prevent someone from dinging their car when attempting to park in such tight spaces. Honestly, my vehicle has taken a few dings from others while parking in the wework garage and it's not a happy feeling. Having a designated area for longer trucks might help. \n",

However I feel really, really strongly that we are overpaying for the space: there is no where quiet, even in private offices - you can hear clearly what is happening in the room next door and there is always something happening in the room next door. If you are a business that does a lot of phone calls or wants to have private meetings, this is not for you. I wish we were just paying for hotseats instead of a private office. When we have calls or private meetings we just work from home!\n",
      "-1 0.029 I receive rent-related emails constantly, despite having asked for the rent related emails to go directly to my client's Finance and Lease Admin team. I handle my client's lease setup, and having nothing to do with the rent payment process once setup has occurred. Getting documentation done accurately and timely was extremely difficult for the initial setup. My client pays rent via check for their 120+ leased locations, but this method of payment is unacceptable to WeWork. WeWork has lost checks and we often get automatic payments saying we have not paid, when we indeed have paid.  When my team has questions related to our client's office, instead of calling up a person and getting immediate feedback, we have to submit a ticket which seems more cumbersome to me.\n",

In 500 7th avenue we were previously on the 9th floor which seemed to have a lot more offices filled which was really nice to get to know the other businesses. In comparison the 12th floor seems dead so you don't have the same networking feel.

      "As a member of WeWork for the past 1.5 years in Mumbai, I use to be a proud and enthusiastic member of the Raheja Platinum WeWork in Mumbai. It is the best working model for every WeWork in Mumbai. They regularly have one of the best events for its members, events on mental health, mindfulness, LGBTQ, fitness, financial planning, musicals, movie nights, stand up comedy, art workshops and the list goes on. These events use to be my stress-busters on a high-pressure work week. Taking time out would help me network with new members and old ones too. Not only does Raheja Platinum have a good line up of events but even a great gym and fresh tea served at the cafeteria area. The tea is not machine-made but a collaboration with the brand 'Chai Point' and I can tell with utmost confidence (being a tea connoisseur) that it is the best tea in the world. Even my colleagues from New York loved the tea so much they actually carried back some tea boxes from India. And to add all these amazing features, the cleanliness of the rooms and bathrooms is top-notch. But as of today, I moved to Spectrum Tower, for its cost-effectiveness but sadly it is a terrible choice made. The cleanliness of this place is horrible. Bathrooms always have a bad odour, the rooms/desks are never cleaned with wet wipes or disinfectants and this concerns the well-being of members. The events are repetitive and meaningless, and there is no fresh tea served unlike the one at Raheja Platinum. The honesty market is never stocked with fresh new items. In fact, the other buildings like Masterpiece, Raheja Platinum always had energy drinks, quick meals like pasta, rice or Thai noodles but this one apparently has partnered with some random chips brand and that is only thing kept in the honesty market and it never sells. Spectrum tower instead has kept a roadside caterer who sells lunch and snacks as a buffet but I wonder how safe it is to consume this type of food which may lack hygiene or food safety standards. With such a terrible member service at Spectrum Tower, Mumbai, I have lost the enthusiasm and pride that I once used to have as a WeWork member. I hope the situation at Spectrum improves especially and most importantly in Hygiene, events and food. I would give a friendly suggestion that WeWork in Mumbai should model Raheja Platinum as a standard and excellent example of the brand principles. Thank you!\n",

Most of WeWork’s competitors have taken the responsible step of shutting down and offering refunds to their members (who are unable or unwilling to use the space during the pandemic).

However, it seems the focus on long term commitment of a 12-month contract versus the long term commitment of return business is a little short-sighted.  I met and know tons of business leaders looking for workspace alternatives to the traditional long term lease options.  I would have told them to head to a WeWork location for a variety of reasons:  events, friendly staff, flexible terms, great locations, stress-free environments, great networking opp, and employee-friendly - just to name a few things.  However, I've seen the stress of the Community team having very difficult conversations with members/partners that are struggling to stay afloat.  We have three (3) commitments with shared spaces across the US and I have unfortunately been spending the most time with WeWork.  My accounting team and the CEO have now stepped into the process.  This usually means there will never be another WeWork location in our future.  This is unfortunate since I really like my WeWork Community teams, but the process of the commitment which is, by the way, goes until October 31, 2020, will burn this relationship.  In five (5) months during a time when Dallas is going through a resurge of COVID cases, there is no negotiations of shortening the term even by one month - we offered to pay everything in July to end the contract 1 month earlier.

During the early days of COVID bathrooms weren't being cleaned or stocked with things like toilet paper or paper towels. It wasn't until July/August that things finally got to where they should be. I lost all my clients and I'm going broke but WeWork refuses to let me out of my lease. So I may have to go to collections ruining my credit or go bankrupt in order to keep a roof over my head. The heartless disgusting policies from WeWork have proven the kind of organization it is. I tried explaining that if I were let out of my lease I would return when my business returned. Instead, I had to sell my car in order to afford to pay my WeWork dues. When people talk about evil corporations, WeWork is what I think of. Unless they did something significant to make me feel better about my situation I wouldn't ever recommend WeWork to anyone and I'm currently in the process of becoming an active advocate against WeWork. I started telling my story to anyone who will listen. If there were a negative number on this scale it wouldn't be low enough. If you believe in a god or afterlife you should rethink your job. You're contributing to the destruction of peoples lives. \"Just following orders\" won't get you into heaven. When WeWork does go out of business, you will be fired without any benefits or severance and when you interview for future jobs employers will ask why you stayed with such a terrible company for so long when any smart person with a sliver of empathy would have left a long time ago.\n",

      "122 0.043 I find it reprehensible that the office staff at Park South, despite assurances that they would prepare mail for forwarding (via my Federal Express or UPS account \"pick-up\" tags) just prior to my stay-at-home sequestering, refused to do so when I pre-notified them that I was sending a pick-up airway bill.  They said that I should contact a courier service.  Shockingly, even with a courier they would be required to at least put the mail in an envelope for the courier... the same thing required for FedEx.  (Please note that I can document all of this in as much as most of the communication was via email or WeWork messenger).  Specifically, the two communicants at the office were Jennifer Soto, the community Manager and Hannah Freund.  In an attempt to escalate this to WeWork Management (Sarah Kurdt) I spoke to Sebastion in your HQ.  While he wasn't in a position to re-direct the call, he did confirm that there had been no order or provision by WeWork management prohibiting or restricting preparation of mail for forwarding by office staff.  (I have a recording of the conversation if there is any doubt of my veracity here).  I have conferred with multiple \"Members\" at the Park South location about this and other \"responsiveness\" issues during the Covid-19 outbreak.

Poor sound insulation in conference rooms connected to common areas so the music bleeds into the room and makes audio conferencing a poor experience. Poor sound insulation from A/C ducting inside office spaces and conference rooms created a loud background sound that is stressful. The amount of bathroom stalls in many locations is not enough. I had one example where I had to go to 4 floors to find an available stall. That was an extreme example but its several times a week where you go into a restroom with no available stalls. Pretty much all locations suffer the problem of people highjacking the common area booths and hotdesks for the entire day.

Also, more offices with private office space within a larger office for 1:1s and calls (need to fix acoustics). Also, WeWork should clean the floors and desk tops of offices each week - it's really gross and dusty. Lastly, our biggest challenge is lack of time and resources. Anything to make life more efficient (the Sweet Green delivery was a good idea) and/or connect other entreprenuers to help each other or find talent. WeWork could do less on silly events and do a better job of curating things that matter to busy entrepreneurs - curated communities and matching of talent, etc. Our community is a hodge podge and does not feel curated like others offer.
